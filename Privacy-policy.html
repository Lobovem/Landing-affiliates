          <div class="text__wrap">
            <h2 class="text__title-text">About Our Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="text__desc">We understand that Your privacy is important to You and that You care about how Your
              personal data is used and shared online. We respect and value the privacy of everyone who visits Our Site
              and will only collect and use personal data in ways that are described here, and in a manner that is
              consistent with Our obligations and Your rights under the law.</p>

            <p class="text__desc">Under the EU Regulation 2016/679 – the General Data Protection Regulation and other
              applicable legislation, We are required to comply with personal data protection and processing procedures
              to ensure that Your data is at all times stored and processed securely and that Your rights as a data
              subject are observed and protected. We take these obligations very seriously and have implemented adequate
              technical and organizational measures to ensure protection of Your privacy.</p>

            <h2 class="text__title-text">What is personal data?</h2>
            <p class="text__desc">The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) defines personal data as:</p>
            <p class="text__desc">“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data
              subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or id in this new manner
              directly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location
              data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
              mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.”</p>
            <p class="text__desc">You, as the Company’s Affiliate, provided that you are a natural person, are the ‘data
              subject’ in relation to this Affiliate Privacy Policy. In short, this means that any personal data
              relating to you as a data subject is protected under data protection law. However, it does not include
              data where the identifiers relating to the data subject have been removed (meaning anonymous data).</p>

            <h2 class="text__title-text">Registration</h2>
            <p class="text__desc">In order to use our site, you must first complete the registration form. When you

              registration form so we can provide you with a more personalized relationship.</p>

            <h2 class="text__title-text">External Links</h2>
            <p class="text__desc">This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not
              responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when
              you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally
              identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site.</p>

            <h2 class="text__title-text">Newsletter</h2>
            <p class="text__desc">If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as
              email addresses. However, it is completely at your discretion to be removed from such a list as set out in
              our choice and opt-out section below.</p>

            <p class="text__desc">We also send you site and service announcement updates. You are not able to
              unsubscribe from these because they contain important information about our site and our services.</p>

            <h2 class="text__title-text">Surveys & Contests</h2>
            <p class="text__desc">From time-to-time we request information from you via surveys or contests.

              under our control. When you submit sensitive information via our site, your information is protected both
              online and off-line. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do
              everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. The servers that we store personally
              identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. If you have any questions about the security
              at our site, you can send an email to marketing@bohoaffiliates.com</p>

            <h2 class="text__title-text">Supplementation of Information</h2>
            <p class="text__desc">In order for this site to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is
              necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from third party sources. We
              send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will
              occasionally receive information on our services and newsletters. Out of respect for the privacy of our
              users, our users have the option not to receive these types of communications (refer to our choice and
              opt-out section below).
            </p>

            <h2 class="text__title-text">Correction/Updating Personal Information:</h2>

              to us. This can be done at the member information page or by emailing us at marketing@bohoaffiliates.com

            <h2 class="text__title-text">Choice/Opt-out</h2>
            <p class="text__desc">If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, information about products and
              services, surveys, or promotional materials from us or our clients you may opt-out of receiving these
              communications by following the unsubscribe instructions in the relevant email.</p>

            <h2 class="text__title-text">Notification of Changes</h2>
            <p class="text__desc">If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes on our
              Homepage and in our newsletter so you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it.
              If we change the way we use your Personally Identifiable Information we will notify you by email in our
              newsletter. If you would like to opt out of having your information used in this new manner, we will ask
              you to contact us within a month and your information will not be used. If you do not contact us within
