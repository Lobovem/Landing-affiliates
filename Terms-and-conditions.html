            <p class="text__desc">6.1 Subject to your adherence to the provisions of the Affiliate Agreement, you will
              earn Commission in accordance with the Commission Structure. We retain the right to change the Commission
              percentage and method of calculation of Commission in accordance with this clause.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.2 The Commission is calculated at the end of each month and payments shall be made
              on a monthly basis in arrears, not later than the 15th of the following calendar month.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.3 Payment of Commission will be made through our Affiliate Wallet. Due to existing
              regulations, Affiliates may be required for verification and “know your customer” documentation before a
              withdrawal can be accessed.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.4 A minimum amount of €100 (one hundred euro) except bank wire transfer the minimum
              threshold for which is €200 (two hundred euro) has to be accumulated in commissions for the payment to be
              made in any given month.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.5 If an error is made in the calculation of the Commission, the Company has the
              right to correct such calculation at any time and will immediately pay out underpayment or reclaim
              overpayment made to the Affiliate.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.6 The Affiliate may, at the Company’s sole discretion, be provided with the
              opportunity to restructure its commission structure.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.7 The Affiliate’s acceptance of a Commission payment shall constitute the full and
              final settlement of the balance due for the relevant period. In case the Affiliate disagrees with the
              balance due as reported, he or she shall notify the Company within fourteen (14) calendar days and clearly
              state reasons for the disagreement. Failure to notify the Company within this time limit shall be
              considered as an irrevocable acknowledgment of the balance due for the relevant period.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.8 The Commission shall be deemed to be exclusive of value added tax or any other
              applicable tax. The Affiliate shall have the sole responsibility to pay any and all taxes, levies, charges
              and any other money payable or due to any tax authority, department or other competent entity as a result
              of the compensation generated under the Affiliate Agreement.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.9 If fraudulent activity from the Affiliate occurs, the Affiliate Program reserves
              the right to review such Affiliate accounts and the traffic being sent. The Affiliate Program does not
              accept incentivised traffic or traffic which displays such characteristics. The Affiliate's payment
              request may be held over for investigation until we can validate that there has been no breach of the
              Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.10 In case of partnership on Hybrid and CPA basis there are several stipulations
              that should be taken into account: Negative Revenue Share will be deducted from CPA part of the
              commission. This stipulation takes effect unless otherwise agreed with the affiliate manager beforehand.
              Duplicate accounts and self-excluded players will be deducted from CPA part of the Commission. This
              stipulation takes effect unless an alternative was discussed with the affiliate manager beforehand. In
              cases certain CAP was negotiated with a partner commission will be paid only for the negotiated number of
              FTDs.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.11 If a player referred by Affiliate files the chargeback commission for such player
              will be withheld from Affiliate's revenue as per Affiliate's commission deal.</p>
            <p class="text__desc">6.12 All crypto revenue (ETH, LTC etc.) will be converted to BTC, while all fiat
              revenue (USD, CAD etc) will be converted and paid in EUR.</p>
